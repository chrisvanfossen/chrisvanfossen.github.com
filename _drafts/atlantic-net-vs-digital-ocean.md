atlantic offers a smaller 256MB instance for 3.65
512 for around 5$
easy sign up until you get to the part where they have to call you to verify something
seems they didn’t have to call, i got an email shortly thereafter that said i was good to go
no login button on atlantic.net, basically a secret link to get to it
outbound port 25 is blocked by default, have to send a plea to open it
server i thought i created when i set up my account wasn’t there
wait it was there, ip username and password displayed
pretty fast provisioning, seemed faster than digital ocean
few minutes to remove the dupe server i created
home page doesn’t show existing servers, have to click on “list”
email with my credentials for my servers was going to spam
ssh login felt quite slow
update / upgrade felt slower than digital ocean as well
no charts for the server, same issue digital ocean had earlier in their life
really slow upgrade
they do have DNS management but you should be using cloudflare anyway
they also have an API and server PTR (unsure if Digital Ocean has either)
you end up getting a shit ton of private IP addresses
still waiting on upgrade to finish, i need to do ths same on Digital Ocea to see how fast it is
no two-factor auth
wait, there is a bandwidth chart, nothing else
maybe it was slower because I was on the 256MB instance
redo build out with comparable digital ocean server, ran side by side
