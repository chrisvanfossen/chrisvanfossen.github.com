how a domain transfer works

domain must be unlocked and at least 60 days old (and not transferred in the last 60 either)

 (it’s recommended to remove any domain privacy as well)

more than 7 days away from expiration

you are issued an authorization code

you go to the new registrar and initial the transfer

you will use the authorization code (emailed to you and often times shown on page)

at this point it will be time to give up some payment information

now domain is in the process of being transferred

email is sent to the administrative contact to confirm the transfer

click the link to continue the process

this took me to a page asking to confirm the transfer again (with some terms & agreement text)

“we have notified the person who requested the transfer” (which was me)

“transfer accepted”

got an email advising that the transfer is approved with the IP address of who accepted the request

it was advised that it may take 5 to 6 days to transfer but some registrars let you expedite

epik.com did not seem to be one of those companies

i went ahead and tried to initial the transfer again and they gave me the expedite link

this allowed me to approve (or cancel) the immediate transfer and it stopped showing up in my epik account

“pending at registry”

at 10:40 the domain was showing as being registered with namesilo, expiration pushed to 2015

it was showing as “unknown domain name”

still pending at registry

10:45 - transfer complete!


started at 10:06 - transfer accepted - 10:20 - 10:32 - 10:38 (expedite)
