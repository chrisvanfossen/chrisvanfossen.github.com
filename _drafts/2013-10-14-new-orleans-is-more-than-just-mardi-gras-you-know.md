title:  New Orleans is more than just Mardi Gras you know
---

Blogging from the French Quarter in New Orleans today. A recent bout of termite infestation has left us with a circus tent full noxious gas enclosing our house and no place to call home for a few days. We were originally going to stay down in Ybor City which is close to our house and even closer to my office but I made the executive decision that we outta get out of town for a few days since we already had a doggy hotel booked for the pugs and we were going to need to stay in a hotel anyway. Destination NOLA!

Leading up to this adventure (and our daughter’s first plane flight, mind you) we were quite excited to tell folks about the trip. The most common reaction? A generally negative one of course! “You’re taking your 6 year old there? But that’s a party town!” I don’t ever claim to be parent of the year (seriously, it was enough of an honor when I was nominated) but taking your child to a cultural mecca like New Orleans shouldn’t be met with such negativity and disdain, not at all.

The fact is, everyone we know that’s ever been to New Orleans has been just as excited as we are about the trip. Why would people be excited? Because they know that there’s more to New Orleans than Mardi Gras and getting blackout drunk while on vacation. My wife and I have both been (took our first road trip together there) and are not only happy to return but even happier to share the rich culture of the area with our daughter. From the old buildings and architecture to the artists in Jackson Square to the wonderful food and yes, even the local drinks (there’s at least one Hand Grenade in my future ;) that define the area, New Orleans is rich in culture for the young and old alike.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that people (especially those that have never been) need to stop generalizing New Orleans as some sinful southern port and think about what the town really has to offer.
