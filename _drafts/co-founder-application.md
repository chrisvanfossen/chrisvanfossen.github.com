title: Co-founder Application
---

I am seeking two or three qualified individuals to join me as co-founders for a yet to be determined venture. I have many ideas but we can use yours as long as everyone on our team is excited about it. Coming up with an idea is going to be the easy part, execution is what matters. “Push early, fail often.” “Ship or die.” “Move fast and break stuff.” And any other cliché quotes you can think of are great, but are up for the challenge of living them?

## About Me:

For the last year I have been working for myself building social networks. After a year of working alone and no forward momentum on a few projects with others, I have come to realize that this man can no longer be an island. Aside from some stints in Corporate America, I have also been a single digit employee at two Tampa startups. One company is still thriving today and the other sold for 7 figures last year. I love technology, I debug in my dreams and I love contributing to open source projects and pushing code.

## Tools I Like:

* PHP, yes PHP, as of late 5.5.x because 5.3 is tired
* MySQL, because I still find PostgreSQL to be a pain
* Memcached, because the fastest database queries are the ones you don’t run
* Redis, because OMFG REDIS!!?!
* nginx, because it’s bad like the PowerGlove
* jQuery, because I have no room for botique libraries in my stack
* Ubuntu Linux, even though I think Unity is junk
* vim, because in another time and place it would have been called prophet

## About You:

You’re a humble code monkey, designer and/or growth hacker. The ability to wear multiple hats is a very sexy attribute.

### You’re a developer

You’re favorite thing in the world is to create. You always have a side project. When you’re not coding, you’re probably coding. You love writing unit tests but you love solving problems more.

### You’re a designer

You have an eye for modern design but don’t mind being a trail blazer. You can take criticism as well as give it. UX isn’t your skill, it’s your passion. You are confortable with Photoshop but can sling markup with the best of them.

### You’re a growth hacker

You have the experience to back up your claim. You’re humble, because everyone hates cocky marketers. You trust your gut but are also willing to analyze metrics and make educated decisions.

## You will be successful in this role if you:

* Enjoy building tools that people want to use
* Are a self starter that can be autonomous and self-motivated
* Get inspired and can inspire others around you
* Like beer

## Next Steps

Full disclosure, an ideal candidate probably won’t have a day
