Talk about the scummy site flippers, shill bidding, encrypted code, spent 197$ and a couple of hours of my life, and that company that does vetting

Took maybe 2 hours to get the site setup on DigitalOcean, figured out the interface, figured out how to get rid of the other affiliate tags, fix the link in the slider, suppress the slider from all but the home page and swap the single leaderboard for 2 medium rectangles in the footer, also set up SEO friendly links

another 15 minutes fixing this:
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING in /var/www/digitalcameradevice.com/aom/themes/default/rss.tpl.php on line 14

<?xml wasn't properly escaped
