title:  Hiring is Not Easy
---

If you've ever worked in a small company, you've heard it before: making amazing hires is **essential** to the long-term health of the company. There's no real room for error in the HR department. I've made recommendations to use a particular product or service or platform that haven't worked out for the team; those types of mistakes are easily remedied with a better product, followed by a (maybe painful) migration, and then life goes on. But I haven't made a bad hire yet, and it's a bit terrifying to think of the consequences.

Every time, we've looked for someone:

 * wicked smart

 * tirelessly dedicated to delivering

 * insanely intellectually curious (rabit holes and tangents into new topics are daily life around these parts)

 * with a love of wordsmithing and communication
 
 * who inhales and exhales bits

The last part requires a bit of explanation and, for our company, it's just as important as the preceding four boxes to check. A new hire for us has to, has to, has to live online somewhere. She/he must breathe the Internet, live the Internet, and navigate and swim in the Internet like a shark. We're an Internet company and (surprise) it's essential that our employees can make the Internet work for them instead of against them. I'm not talking about DNS look-ups, HTTP requests, other requests/responses, or HTML. I'm talking about one of the largest, most accessible tools that we have available to us as an interconnected society and using it to solve problems. Whether that problem is getting the most recent news or sourcing a script to unravel a Caesar/shift cipher doesn't matter. Proving that you own *some* type of stomping grounds is.
