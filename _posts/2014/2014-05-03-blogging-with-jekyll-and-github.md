title:  Blogging with Jekyll and Github

I knew I wanted to improve my command line and git skills; what better way than to host static pages on Github? I can use [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), quite possibly the best text editor ever, hang out on the command line, and build fast static pages in a snap.

Working as a product manager at my current startup, a [market research platform called MindSwarms](http://www.mindswarms.com), has really convinced me that the best way to learn is "hands on." Consider this a formal taking-the-gloves-off.
