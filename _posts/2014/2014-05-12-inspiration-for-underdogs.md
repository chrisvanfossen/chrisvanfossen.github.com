title:  Inspiration for Underdogs
---

A simple question got me thinking recently about the little guys, the Davids, and the underdogs. The prompt: "What would I develop if I had a few hundred engineers working under my direction?" Or really, what *couldn't* I do?

But a small startup won't have hundreds of engineers. It won't have millions (probably) to spend on products that aren't within its core competency.

In fact, lack of assets is a continual consideration in much of our operations. Do we make a new hire, or do we invest in infrastructure? Do we develop feature #1 or feature #2, since we can't do both until cashflow increases? Do we hire a designer, or do we do our research homework and then design for ourselves?

As a self-proclaimed "little guy," there are ways in which we can disrupt an industry that the big guys cannot; we're nimble, we're flexible, we grow organically. For MindSwarms, we're a research platform; we're disrupting the way that companies do qualitative research. We're mobile. We're asynchronous. We're one-on-none. We're 1-minute-only.

On the other hand, all those industries we're not trying to disrupt... we want to be at least as good as our competitors in those spaces. Sales processes, web-dev processes, marketing solutions, accounting solutions, HR practices, etc. -- we're not reinventing the whole approach as a business model, so we certainly don't want to reinvent the wheel when we can avoid it. We need it to be efficient and effective so we can focus on our major goal.

And that's where the inspiration for underdogs comes in. When we don't have the money to hire a UX/UI researcher, we often look to the successful tech giants for education and inspiration. Have you seen the [Google Nexus](http://www.google.com/intl/all/nexus/) website? It's stunning and it utilizes parallax scrolling in a way that isn't trite or tired. We study user paths, replicate ecosystems, and see how it feels. [MailChimp](www.mailchimp.com) is an amazing example of how to be fun and educational with your user base. When we don't have the people power to research the latest and greatest digital content marketing strategies, we go out and model ourselves after Marketo and Hubspot. Maybe we need to be inspired by clean and creative design; we can look to [Sosh](www.sosh.com). 

When we don't have the funds to hire an expert in the area, at least we can learn from and be inspired by the specialists in companies with those deep pockets. I have a folder on my desktop called "Вдохновение" (it's just Russian for inspiration) It's just filled with screenshots of web experiences that I found awesome, educational, fun, or new. I believe it's OK to be inspired by people and companies who know more than me and who have the ability to donate time and resources to an area where I don't.

We innovate where we want to, and learn from others where we can't or won't.
