title:  Client Demands Come First
---

I've heard that the only things which remain certain are death and taxes. I think another one might be "your clients will need you, and you will help." I don't mean it in a bad way, either; evil clients aside. This is a more basic order. When you provide a service, the client is using your service in an hour of need. If something ever pops up (and it will), you have to be ready and able to lend a helping hand.

I'm happy to work on someone else's timeline. I have a feeling that will change eventually, but for now, one of the best feelings out there is knowing you have been someone's Superman for an hour. Rescuing another's project, proposal, or presentation is a sweet, sweet thing.
