title:  ID Much?! Site’s gone, but the dream’s still alive
---

This is less of an update and more me wanting to stash this image. In my effort to focus and not waste time on “weekend sites” idmuch.com is expired and long gone. What’s not long gone is the concept. I still write “ID Much?” on the back on my cards, and I’m still greeted with laughs. More importantly, I’m asked to see my ID most of the time.

Function of the Day is also being retired, I vow to never commit myself to an “of the day” ever again.
