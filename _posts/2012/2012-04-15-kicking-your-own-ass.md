So I’ve been busy and have neglected reading for a few weeks now and decided to pick up [Cold Hard Truth: On Business, Money & Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385671741/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joshtronic-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385671741) as I’ve recently become obsessed with Kevin O’Leary’s Twitter feed and figured it would be a semi-decent read as I wait for my [Kevin O’Leary meme](/images/kevin-oleary-meme.jpg) to catch on.

Well turns out the aforementioned book wasn’t available for the Kindle, for shame. Because of this, I decided to see what other “sharks” had books out there, specifically [Mark Cuban](http://blogmaverick.com/) as he’s slowly become my favorite on Shark Tank. As I was searching, I stumbled upon [How to Win at the Sport of Business: If I Can Do It, You Can Do It](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006AX6ONI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=joshtronic-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006AX6ONI) an eBook that is a compilation of blog posts that Mark has done. Inexpensive and not 1000+ pages… I’m in!

Well that was a few hours ago and I’ve since read the entire thing cover to cover, something that hasn’t happened, ever. Granted, it was short but I was absolutely hooked to the point that am overflowing with motivation.

The book itself is just as advertised, a compilation of posts from Mark’s blog so if you’re an avid reader of the blog (which I was not at the time) you very well may have already read the book. Even though I just read it, I can easily see reading it again and again whenever I’m feeling like I need a swift kick in the ass.

I’m deliberately avoiding going into much detail just because I don’t like when a review of a book is just a regurgitation of the content, but there was one valuable thing mentioned that I thought was right on the money considering my experience trying to buy Kevin O’Leary’s book. Mark discussed the path of least resistance that people will take to get something, and that you have to ensure your product is available in the easiest way possible. Uncle Kevin, your publisher fucked up the sale by not making the book available for the Kindle, and for that reason, I’m out.
