title:  Dumping Android for an iPhone
---

This should probably be accompanied by a formal press release, but I’ve dumped my Android phone for an iPhone 4S. As of late, I’ve been comparing Android to Linux in the mid-to-late 90s. It’s great if you like to fight with your system and constantly deal with adapting to it’s shortcomings, but for day-to-day use, it’s far from ready (my opinion so STFU and go rant on your own blog).

Keep in mind, this is all based on an older phone (MyTouch3G) and it constantly being out performed by my wife’s jailbroken iPhone 3G (which came out a year prior to my phone). I’ll probably give Android another go in the future, but for the moment I’ve been soured by constantly asking my phone “what the fuck are you doing?”

The background sync left me the most frustrated. Seemed everytime I’d get network coverage with my carrier, the phone would sync and force everything else to a crawl. Speaking of crawling, the dialer would take upwards of 30 seconds to get to the point that my call was being made, but what if it was urgent?! As of late, I’ve been charging my phone nearly all day every day. Not because of poor battery life, but because some app would get stuck in the background, drain my battery and heat my phone up like a volcano (and you can’t check what app was eating up the battery if your phone dies o_O as it resets the usage meters). Did I mention the random reboots? Yeah, random reboots, sometimes 2 and 3 in a row.

Now I’m aware that I could just flash my phone with the stock ROM or a custom one to get the performance back, but that’s not the point (plus I got tired of doing that). That mentality reminds me too much of the old Windows performance decrease over time, forcing you to reinstall 6 months to maintain performance (unsure if that’s still the case, it’s been a while…).

At this point in my life, I’ll take polish over flexibility… now I’m wondering if OSX will be making a triumphant return to the Sherman Compound.
