You may have already noticed but my blog recently received an “unvamping” and has been stripped of nearly all CSS (there’s a small bit to set the body width since I forgot how that could be done without CSS :-O).

“Why,” you ask? Pretty simple actually. My blog’s never been a highlight of my design portfolio, I’m never happy with how it looks and after seeing [Coda Hale’s blog](http://codahale.com/), I thought “ya know, it’s about what I’m saying, not how it looks”

So yeah, my blog looks like shit, but at least I’m blogging. Expect to see my anti-theme in the Tumblr theme store soon, probably named “The Dream of the 90s” and it will cost at least $9,000.
