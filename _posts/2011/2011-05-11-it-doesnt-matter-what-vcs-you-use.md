title:  "Version Control: It doesn’t matter what system you use"
---

CVS vs SVN, SVN vs Git, Git vs Mercurial… who fucking cares. I’ve been through my share of version control systems (CVS, Visual Source Safe, SVN, Serena PVCS and Dimensions and as of late, git) and the one thing that stands out to me is that it doesn’t matter which one you use.

## Wait, what?! FLAME ON! My choice is better than yours!

Shocker here, this isn’t flame bait. Why? Because I don’t care enough about my own dogmatic version control choices to argue with you about them. See, it turns out *what* you’re building and storing in the version control system is what actually matters. Obviously, some systems are better / easier than others but at the end of the day, if you’re trying to raise investment capital no one’s going to shy away because you use XYZ system. They should shy away if you’re not insightful enough to have version control in place to begin with.

If the version control system you’re using is actually negatively impacting your work flow and/or your ability to ship, by all means fix the glitch, because that’s what really matters.
