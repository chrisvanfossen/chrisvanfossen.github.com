title:  "Tux ‘n Droid: How I spent not even 2 months as a starving webcomic artist"
---

*It’s [was] like The Odd Couple, but not as funny.* Incidentally, starting a webcomic seemed like a great idea at the time. I knew it was going to be hard to keep the content coming, so I cut some corners with the art (a la [Dinosaur Comics](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php)) by having some pre-done graphics and sticking to 3 panels.

Major downfall was trying to do 3 comics a week. Week 1 started on a Wednesday so it was only 2 comics, and for the next 3 weeks I was doing 3 comics a week, then took a week off and ended on a high note by doing another 3fer week. A total of 14 comics total and officially defunct as I’m letting the domain expire.

Perhaps not my most fruitful endeavor, it was definitely fun at the time. What’s really bitchin’ is telling people I’m a retired webcomic artist. Please enjoy the following Tux ‘n Droid anthology in all it’s glory. If anyone wants to rekindle the comic, let me know I’ll send you the XCF files ;)
