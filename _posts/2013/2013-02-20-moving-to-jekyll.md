title:  Moving from Tumblr to Jekyll (and GitHub!)
---

As you may remember, I moved my blog (and my wife’s blog and every other site blog I have) to Tumblr. At the time, it made perfect sense. Tumblr’s platform is quite robust and they have a dedicated staff that is enhancing the system (something my own blogging platform did not have). Over the course of the past year using Tumblr, I did find myself blogging more and not focusing on what my own blogging platform lacked / needed implemented. The design of my blog was also stripped down as well. I wanted to keep the UI as minimal as possible so that I could focus on content.

Such minimalism eventually led me to embracing Jekyll and utilizing GitHub for hosting of my blog. As someone that spends 80% of my time on the computer on the CLI, it only makes sense. I’m now able to edit my blog the same way I edit code (VIM!) and deploy from command-line as well. So yet again, the structure of my URI’s is changing and I’m fucking up my link juice. It will take a few days before my blog is completely migrated over and *hopefully* this will be for the last time. Oh, and expect some enhancements, as I’ve grown tired of the dream of the 90’s design chic.
