post:   "DirectNIC may have been compromised"
---

Didn’t see any news about it this AM but it seems that DirectNIC may have been compromised. My wife just spoke with Bank of America regarding fraudulent activity on her credit card. According to the person she spoke with, DirectNIC had been compromised and there was a ping against her account to see if it was active (the transaction amount was undisclosed and is not showing up in her account at all). The representative from BOA also stated that DirectNIC was aware of the issue and authorities have been contacted. I have checked the credit card I have on file with them and there is a $0.00 transaction amount from “DIRECTNIC.COM” in pending as of November 11th, 2013. Normally transactions from DirectNIC show up as “WWW.DIRECTNIC.COM” and I did not make any domain purchases from them yesterday either.

If you use DirectNIC, I’d check your credit card you have on file immediately!
