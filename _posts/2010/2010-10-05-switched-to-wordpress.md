title:  Why I recently switched to WordPress
---

Anyone that knows me knows that I’m not a huge fan of using canned web applications. I find them to be insecure (talking to you OSCommerce) often times a pain to upgrade and more often than that a nightmare to customize. Keep in mind that I do feel WordPress is fairly insecure (especially if you don’t keep it updated) but I do find the feature set to be very robust and the ability to theme it is there (although I’ve yet to jump into that yet).

So yeah, I got tired of maintaining my blog and decided to go all mainstream and trendy and install WordPress. The features are there, there are great mobile apps to support it. Even though I don’t use the iPad to write my blog posts, I do love using it to go through comments and such. Other main advantage (for me at least) was the ability to import in my old Blogger blogs so now I have a master blog with all my old crap in it. Yeah, I could have done that with my code, and I could have spent time building out all the same functionality, but let’s be honest here, I don’t have time for that. I’d rather be focusing on my own projects or strumming the guitar and drinking scotch.
