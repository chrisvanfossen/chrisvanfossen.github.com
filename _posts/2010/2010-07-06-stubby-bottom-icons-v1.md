title:  Stubby Bottom Icons v1
---

Been toying around with designing icons, specifically icons for social media websites. Got tired of trying to find a matching set of icons that included all the icons that I needed (paid or free). After redesigning the icons over at [CrowdSavings.com](http://www.crowdsavings.com/), I went ahead and created the Stubby Bottom icons to eventually replace the icons already in use on this site. If you like the icons and are looking for any specific services to be added, drop me a line. Next version will include icons for email, Last.fm, YouTube, Google [Profile] and Brazil’s favorite Orkut!

Icons include Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, RSS, Gmail, Yahoo!, Windows Live, LinkedIn, Plaxo, ShareThis, Digg, Flickr, StumbleUpon, Blogger, Tumblr and a blank icon just in case you want to create your own.

These are free for both personal and commercial endeavors. Don’t go selling them, the karma police are watching. If you use them, a link back would be great, but most people are scum bags so I don’t expect it. Regardless, please let me know if you found these icons useful and send me links of them in action!
