title:  Ditched WordPress
---

To at least one person’s dismay, I have abandoned WordPress for not only my blog, but for any future endeavours. WordPress seems great if you can’t build a blog on your own and would rather interact with a series of plug-ins than get your hands dirty with some code. I’m not that guy, so I’m out.

For those wondering what actually caused this change of heart after 2 months of using it here’s the details. WordPress upgrades rely heavily on FTP/FTPS and I don’t use FTP on my server (by choice mind you). There is an alternative workflow for using SFTP (SSH2), but the file permissions that needed to be set for it to work were all 777 and well, that’s insecure and I wasn’t having it.
