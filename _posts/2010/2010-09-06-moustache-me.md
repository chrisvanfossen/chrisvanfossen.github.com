Sucks when you put a chunk of hours into something just to realize that someone else has already done it. Case in point, I finished up [Moustache.ME](http://moustache.me) after realizing that someone already runs Mustache.me on a similar concept. Well I’m sticking to my guns on “moustache” being the proper spelling, and without ado, yet another site of mine for people to not use. Moustache.ME is a simple site, you upload a photo, draw some shit on it, then share it. Preferably, the “shit” is a moustache.
