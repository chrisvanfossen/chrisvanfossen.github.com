title:  Gravity Boulevard Redesign
---

Been a few years since the original design was put in place, and I was starting to think the site was a bit too sterile / business-y (especially since I have retired from doing freelance [again]). New site attempts to be hip and modern by using a high res photograph for the background, and all those wonderful jQuery effects, big fonts, rounded corners and non-standard web fonts the world has come to expect. Tough shit if you’re on IE, I’m sure it looks like hell. [Visit the brand new Gravity Boulevard.com](http://gravityblvd.com/)
