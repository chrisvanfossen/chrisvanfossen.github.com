title:  What could you do in 10k?
---

I’m typically not the type to engage in any sort of popularity contest, especially those of which include either musical or technical ability, as it’s all so opinionated. That being said, I decided to enter something in the [10k An Event Apart](http://10k.aneventapart.com/) as it was suggested to me by [Justin Davis](http://twitter.com/jwd2a) of [Madera Labs](http://www.maderalabs.com/) as something he felt was right up my ally. Well, he was right, as my head is often times found right up the ass of the optimization monster, especially with my recent trials and tribulations of MySQL performance on [RackSpace CloudSites](http://www.rackspacecloud.com/). So without further adieu, I present to you [River of DOOM!!!](http://10k.aneventapart.com/Entry/168) a tunnel-style game reminiscent of both SkiFree and RiverRaid all at the same time. Oh BTW, vote me up bitches!
