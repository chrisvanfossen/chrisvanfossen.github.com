title:  Pidgin Issues Revisited
---

Welp, the mysterious Pidgin I was receiving a while back popped back up. For those that don’t remember, it was “Oops, father has gone, wait for me, wait…!” and then a segfault. Well the issue magically corrected itself the last time, so I was at a loss for what to do this time around. Fortunately Firefox decided to give me a big error message when trying to watch a video. The gist of the message was “hey fool, you’re out of disk space”. I learned a valuable lesson that 100GB for my Linux partition is a gross underestimate of the space I needed. Fortunately, my new 1.5TB drive from Dell came in the mail, now if only I had time to install it!
