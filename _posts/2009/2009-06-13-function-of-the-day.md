title:  "New Project: Function of the Day"
---

So I’ve bought yet another domain, but actually got a site up in a timely fashion this time. The site is called [Function of the Day](http://functionoftheday.com) and it’s just that, a site that presents a single programming function every day. Right now it only supports PHP, but the plan is to add more languages as time progresses. Assuming the site gains a bit of interest from the community, the sooner new languages will be added. Hell, if you really want to see the ball get rolling faster, get in touch, and I’ll put you to work.
