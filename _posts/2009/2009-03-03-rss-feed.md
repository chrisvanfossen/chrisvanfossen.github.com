title:  New Feature, an RSS Feed!
---

Sadly, I failed to add an RSS feed to the site when it initially launched. Even sadder, the “system” I have been developing for the last year (it’s called PICKLES and is about to make it to revision 100 in Subversion!) has a nice display module for RSS feeds, so all of the leg work was already done. Well I took a small bit of time for myself this evening before jumping back on a freelance project to add the feed capabilities to the site. Enjoy!
