title:  RMS makes me want to be a better person
---

So I’ve been following the saga of [Tomboy Notes (and subsequently Mono) being added to the Debian install](http://robertmh.wordpress.com/2009/06/12/mono-in-the-default-install/). On the surface, it seems fairly harmless, and part of that is because I not only use Tomboy, but I enjoy it. As part of the ongoing saga, Richard M. Stallman (RMS) has [spoken out against](http://www.fsf.org/news/dont-depend-on-mono) the inclusion because .NET is not free software.

Regardless of where this all falls, I have to come out and say that RMS makes me want to be a better person. So much so, that I even gave [gNewSense](http://www.gnewsense.org/) a once over to perhaps alleviate my shackles towards non-free software. Well, as much as I want to be a better person, and I may even give up Tomboy / any other Mono apps for that matter, I don’t see me using an operating system that doesn’t seem to handle my wireless card when I boot up the Live CD. I’m hoping to give [Gobuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/gobuntu) a try soon, I’m assuming it will work better than gNewSense out of the box.

So yeah, RMS is definitely a better person than I… for now.
